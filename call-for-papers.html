Call for Papers:

The IJCAI 2015 Workshop on Semantic Cities: Beyond AI Models, Proofs
and Reasoning

Buenos Aires, Argentina; July 25-31, 2015
Web Site: http://emap.fgv.br/semanticcities-2015/
Submission Site: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semcities15 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Description

Cities around the world aspire to provide superior quality of life to
their citizens. Furthermore, many are also seen as centers of unique
opportunities, like business, fashion, entertainment and governance,
for their citizens. Cities want to retain such pre-eminent positions
or re-position themselves for newer opportunities. But, resources
needed to reach and sustain such aspirations are decreasing while the
expectations continue to rise from an increasing population-base. A
positive trend of the Internet age is that more data than even before
is open and accessible, including from governments at all levels of
jurisdiction, which enables rigorous analysis.

The scientific community has responded to city challenges by promoting
the computational sustainability vision where resources consumed by a
city, such as water, energy, land, food and air, can be monitored to
know the accurate present picture and then optimized for resource
efficiency without degrading quality of services it provides -traffic
movement, water availability, sanitation, public safety, etc. Industry
has joined the vision with a "smart" or "intelligent" prefix for
cyber-physical systems, which involve sensing the data through
physical instruments, interconnecting and integrating them from
multiple sources, analyzing them for intelligent patterns and
inferring new insight for decision making. This effort needs access to
city data, AI models to abstract city domains as well as interconnect
them so that advanced AI techniques, AI reasoning and new generation
of applications can be built by rest of the world. We will like to
call cities that enable such capabilities as, "semantic cities". In
particular this workshop addresses "Beyond AI models, proofs and
reasoning" where models and reasoning techniques from the AI community
are of special interest.

This workshop aims to bring clarity and foster the communication among
AI researchers, domain experts and city and local government
officials. In that context, we want to:

1. Draw the attention of the AI community to the research challenges
   and opportunities in semantic cities.

2. Draw the attention on the multi-disciplinary dimension and its
   impact on semantic cities e.g., transportation, energy, water
   management, building, infrastructure

3. Identify unique issues of this domain and what new (hybrid)
   techniques may be needed. As example, since governments and
   citizens are involved, data security and privacy are first-class
   concerns.

4. Promoting more cities to become semantic cities

5. Elaborating a (semantic data) benchmark for testing AI techniques
   on semantic cities

6. Provide a platform for sharing best-practices and discussion

We will encourage submissions that show the relevance or application
of AI technologies for computational sustainability domains. Apart
from focus on foundational technologies for semantic cities
(information management, knowledge management, ontology, inference
model, data integration, machine learning, crowdsourcing), we will
promote illustrative use-cases using the semantic cities
foundation. Examples are transportation (traffic prediction,
diagnosis, personal travel optimization, carpool and fleet
scheduling), public safety (suspicious activity detection, disaster
management), healthcare (disease diagnosis and prognosis, pandemic
management), water management (flood prevision, quality monitoring,
fault diagnosis), food (food traceability, carbon-footprint tracking),
energy (smart grid, carbon-footprint tracking, electricity consumption
forecasting) and buildings (energy conservation, fault detections). We
will also encourage submissions that address unique characteristics of
standard AI enabling sustainability problems, like optimization,
reasoning, planning and learning. We will also "reach out" to
communities engaged in open data and corresponding standardization
efforts.

We also encourage submissions from communities engaged in open data
and corresponding standardization efforts, not necessarily within the
AI community. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

1. AI models and analytics for cities
2. Active learning, sampling biases and dataset shift in city data
3. Process to open city (government) data
4. Platforms to manage government data
5. Planning/Scheduling for city operations
6. Provenance, access control and privacy-preserving issues in open data
7. Data cities interoperability
8. Decision making for urban science and for city policy
9. Resource allocation in urban systems
10. Crowdsourcing for urban science and decision making
11. Semantic models – especially those built collaboratively and evolving
12. Data integration and organization in semantic cities (social media
    feeds, sensor data)
13. Internet of Things in semantic cities
14. Robust inference models for semantic cities
15. Semantic Event detection and classification
16. Applications in semantic cities
17. Spatio-temporal reasoning, analysis and visualization
18. User interaction in exploring semantic data of cities
19. Knowledge representation and reasoning challenges
20. Knowledge acquisition, evolution and maintenance
21. Challenges with managing and integrating real-time and historical data
22. Managing “big data” using knowledge representation models
23. Multi-agent simulations of urban processes
24. Integrated systems
25. Applied AI models for semantic cities
26. Issues in scaling out and applying AI techniques for semantic cities
27. Case studies, successes, lessons learnt
28. Public datasets and competitions
29. Intelligent user interface

* Workshop Series

The workshop continues the workshop on semantic cities at AAAI 2012,
IJCAI 2013, AAAI 2014 whose attendees backgrounds included Knowledge
Representation, AI Planning and scheduling, Multi-Agent Systems,
Constraints Satisfiability and Search.

* Workshop Format

The workshop will consist of papers, poster presentations,
demonstrations, a panel, an invited talk, and discussion sessions, in
a one full day schedule. The invited talk will invite a leading expert
in the field to present their research and vision of future work. The
panel will focus on connecting the AI researchers to the various
challenges that the targeted domain brings. The schedule will follow
the schedule of the 2012, 2013 and 2014 editions, all grouped by topic
and type (invited talk, long, short and demonstration papers, panel).

* Submission Guidelines

Papers must be formatted in IJCAI two-column, camera-ready
style. Regular research papers (submitted and final), which present a
significant contribution, may be no longer than 7 pages, where page 7
must contain only references, and no other text whatsoever. Short
papers (submitted and final), which describe a position on the topic
of the workshop or a demonstration/tool, may be no longer than 4
pages, references included.

* Submission site

Papers are to be submitted online at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semcities15. We request
interested authors to login and submit abstracts as an expression of
interest before the actual deadline.

* Important Dates

April 15, 2015: Paper Submission Deadline 
May 1, 2015: Notification Decision
May 15, 2015: Camera Ready Due
July ?, 2015: Workshop date
