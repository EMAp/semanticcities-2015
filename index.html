  <h2> The IJCAI 2015 Workshop on Semantic Cities: Beyond AI Models, Proofs and Reasoning </h2>

  <h2>Description</h2>

<p>Cities around the world aspire to provide superior quality of life to
their citizens. Furthermore, many are also seen as centers of unique
opportunities, like business, fashion, entertainment and governance,
for their citizens. Cities want to retain such pre-eminent positions
or re-position themselves for newer opportunities. But, resources
needed to reach and sustain such aspirations are decreasing while the
expectations continue to rise from an increasing population-base. A
positive trend of the Internet age is that more data than even before
is open and accessible, including from governments at all levels of
jurisdiction, which enables rigorous analysis.</p>

<p>The scientific community has responded to city challenges by promoting
the computational sustainability vision where resources consumed by a
city, such as water, energy, land, food and air, can be monitored to
know the accurate present picture and then optimized for resource
efficiency without degrading quality of services it provides -traffic
movement, water availability, sanitation, public safety, etc. Industry
has joined the vision with a "smart" or "intelligent" prefix for
cyber-physical systems, which involve sensing the data through
physical instruments, interconnecting and integrating them from
multiple sources, analyzing them for intelligent patterns and
inferring new insight for decision making. This effort needs access to
city data, AI models to abstract city domains as well as interconnect
them so that advanced AI techniques, AI reasoning and new generation
of applications can be built by rest of the world. We will like to
call cities that enable such capabilities as, "semantic cities". In
particular this workshop addresses "Beyond AI models, proofs and
reasoning" where models and reasoning techniques from the AI community
are of special interest.</p>

<p>In a Semantic City, available resources are harnessed safely,
sustainably and efficiently to achieve positive, measurable economic
and societal outcomes. Enabling City information as a utility, through
a robust (expressive, dynamic, scalable) and (critically) a
sustainable technology and socially synergistic ecosystem could drive
significant benefits and opportunities. Data (and then information and
knowledge) from people, systems and things is the single most scalable
resource available to City stakeholders to reach the objective of
semantic cities.</p>

<p>Two major trends are supporting semantic cities - open data and
Artificial Intelligence. "Open data is the idea that certain data
should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they
wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms
of control ." A number of cities and government have made their data
publicly available, prominent being London (UK), Chicago (USA),
Washington DC (USA), Dublin (Ireland). Artificial Intelligence as a
mature research discipline is crucial to bring breakthrough new
technologies and systems to cities, its operators and citizens. Thus,
a playfield for more AI research-driven technologies for cities has
emerged.</p>

<p>In this context, the aims of the workshop are to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Draw the attention of the AI community to the research challenges
and opportunities in semantic cities.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw the attention on the multi-disciplinary dimension and its
impact on semantic cities e.g., transportation, energy, water
management, building, infrastructure</p></li>
<li><p>Identify unique issues of this domain and what new (hybrid)
techniques may be needed. As example, since governments and citizens
are involved, data security and privacy are first-class concerns.</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting more cities to become semantic cities.</p></li>
<li><p>Elaborating a (semantic data) benchmark for testing AI techniques on
semantic cities.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a platform for sharing best-practices and discussion.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>We will encourage submissions that show the relevance or application
of AI technologies for computational sustainability domains. Apart
from focus on foundational technologies for semantic cities
(information management, knowledge management, ontology, inference
model, data integration, machine learning, crowdsourcing), we will
promote illustrative use-cases using the semantic cities
foundation. Examples are transportation (traffic prediction,
diagnosis, personal travel optimization, carpool and fleet
scheduling), public safety (suspicious activity detection, disaster
management), healthcare (disease diagnosis and prognosis, pandemic
management), water management (flood prevision, quality monitoring,
fault diagnosis), food (food traceability, carbon-footprint tracking),
energy (smart grid, carbon-footprint tracking, electricity consumption
forecasting) and buildings (energy conservation, fault detections). We
will also encourage submissions that address unique characteristics of
standard AI enabling sustainability problems, like optimization,
reasoning, planning and learning. We will also "reach out" to
communities engaged in open data and corresponding standardization
efforts.</p>
